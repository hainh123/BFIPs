## Simple Summary

This is a counter proposal to BFIP-5 to BFIP-9. I propose 5 pools with the following weight:

 - 80/20 Uniswap pool - YFI - Boost
 - 80/20 Uniswap Pool - YFV - Boost
 - 80/20 Uniswap Pool - SUSHI - Boost
 - 80/20 Uniswap Pool - ETH - Boost
 - 80/20 Uniswap Pool - YFII - Boost

Each will be allocated 6000 Boosts each, totalling 30000 Boost tokens

## Abstract

The core strengths of BOOST are fair distribution and governance,  This will generate liquidity to respective pairs + more boost tokens will be stashed into those liquidity pools.
